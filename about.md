**🚀 SYSTEM STATUS: LEARNING MODE ACTIVATED 🚀**

Hey there! I'm Kevin, and welcome to my corner of the digital frontier where I document my journey from data analyst to aspiring developer.

## **🔧 Current Mission**
- **New to coding** but diving deep with AI-powered tools like **Cursor AI**
- Building practical projects and apps while learning core development techniques I never picked up in school
- Leveraging my professional background in **data & analytics** as a foundation for development work

## **💼 Day Job Reality**
- **Power BI developer** by trade - turning raw data into actionable insights
- Trying to bridge the gap between business intelligence and full-stack development
- Always looking for ways to make data tell better stories

## **🏠 Home Lab Adventures**
- **Raspberry Pi enthusiast** - hosting music servers, Flask apps, and databases
- Building and breaking things in my homelab setup
- Learning through hands-on experimentation (and plenty of Stack Overflow)

## **⚙️ Tech Stack & Preferences**
- **Manjaro Linux** - because life's too short for Windows updates
- **Lenovo T480** - my trusty development companion (seriously underrated machine!)
- Python, SQL, and whatever else I need to make things work

## **🎵 Beyond the Code**
- Occasional posts about **music** and other random interests
- Documenting the wins, fails, and "wait, how did that work?" moments
- Sharing the journey from business analyst to full-stack developer
